# Ziggy2
Potential replacement for ziggy, The sample class shows how, given a generic form, we should be able to create the relational database tables complete with foreign key constraint 
to save and using the same heuristic process later retrive the data from the database.

If for example we have a form Farmer who grows crops(apples) we should be able to create table Farmer complete with all the fields and link it to apples table.
